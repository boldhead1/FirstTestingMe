git pull git@github.com:boldhead1/FirstTestingMe.git

To add file just update any file in git pull folder

git status 

(This will show you what file you are trying to update" red mean not yet commit or added 
green mean it is added and ready to be commited)


git add 
If you use "*" that mean it is wild card and it will commit everything on red-ready to be commited

it is good practice to commit by file name

git commit -m "message"

This will commit and add commit message, always make sure you keep your commit message short and sweet.


git push 

This will push into remote repository , if you are in any other branch add branch name when you commit
